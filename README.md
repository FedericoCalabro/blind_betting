# blind_betting

I build this python script in order to help my almost fully blind dad.

He likes betting online, but he cannot do it anymore.

So I've build this up to make his life a bit easier.

How it works:
-The palinsesto.pdf is downloaded from Sisal
-The pdf is being read
-The read data is being transformed/filtered
-The transformed data is being saved into a csv
-The pyscript groups data by country/league into a dict
-The pyscript executes keyboards commands while reading 'current_selection'
