# blind_betting

I build this python script in order to help my almost fully blind dad.<br/><br/>

He likes betting online, but he cannot do it anymore.<br/><br/>

So I've build this up to make his life a bit easier.<br/><br/>

How it works:<br/>
-The palinsesto.pdf is downloaded from Sisal<br/>
-The pdf is being read<br/>
-The read data is being transformed/filtered<br/>
-The transformed data is being saved into a csv<br/>
-The pyscript groups data by country/league into a dict<br/>
-The pyscript executes keyboards commands while reading 'current_selection'<br/>
